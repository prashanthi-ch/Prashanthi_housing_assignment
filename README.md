# Advanced Regression Assignment 

Using an advanced regression model, we are trying to identify variables that are significant in predicting house prices, and how well they describe house prices.


General Information
The US-based housing company Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. Using data analytics, the company purchases houses below their actual values and flips them for a profit. The company has also collected data on Australian house sales for the same purpose. 

In order to enter the market, the company is looking at prospective properties to buy. To determine whether to invest in the prospective properties, you must build a regression model using regularisation.

Specifically, the company is interested in: • Which variables are significant in predicting house prices, and • How well these variables describe house prices.
